# Scope for Improvements in Medical RAG Chatbot

## High Priority Improvements

1. **Streaming LLM Responses**
   - Implement server-sent events (SSE) or WebSockets for streaming responses
   - Modify the LLM integration to use OpenAI's streaming API
   - Update the frontend to progressively render tokens as they arrive
   - Reduce perceived latency by showing partial responses during generation

2. **Enhanced Medical Context**
   - Incorporate medical knowledge graphs for better entity recognition(Graph-RAG)
   - Add medical terminology dictionaries for improved query understanding

## Feature Enhancements

1. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Add chat history persistence
   - Implement progressive disclosure of medical information
   - Add visual elements for medical concepts (diagrams, structures) - Multimodal RAG
   - Support for voice input and accessibility features

2. **Evaluation Framework**
   - Implement automated evaluation using medical QA datasets
   - Add support for human feedback collection
   - Create benchmarks for retrieval accuracy on medical corpora
   - Develop metrics specific to medical information quality
